## Data Description
### Basic Information
- **File Type**: flac
- **Sampling Rate**: 16000
- **Key**: 

| value | label |
| ------- | ------- |
|   0      |    bonafide     |
|   1      |    spoof     |


**Notice**: 
1. Since the models employed in our experiment were trained on the dataset [Bisher/ASVspoof_2019_LA](https://huggingface.co/datasets/Bisher/ASVspoof_2019_LA/viewer/default), the fundamental information of this dataset is identical to that of the aforementioned dataset. 
2. In this dataset, due to the presence of audio recordings that are a combination of human-generated audio and AI-generated or cloned audio, we have designated a key value of 1 for all audio samples that incorporate AI audio elements. Conversely, for audio samples consisting solely of human-generated audio, the key value is set to 0.  

### Naming Format

```
Audio_<Sentence Index>_<Speaker Id>_<Audio Type>_<Sub Type>_<Combine Pattern>.flac
```

### Args Explain
#### Sentence Index
- **Index Range**: [0, 103]
- **Definition**: The value within this index range represents the sequential number of a sentence within the reading material. 

#### Speaker Id
- **Index Range**: [0, 13]
- **Definition**:
    - Indices ranging from 0 to 11 correspond to the 12 human participants in the dataset.
    - Index 12 is assigned to the male - voiced audio directly generated by AI, while index 13 is designated for the female - voiced audio directly generated by AI.
